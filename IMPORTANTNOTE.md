# Project change
Our group changed our project idea after submitting our proposal. Our new idea \
is to search for promotions that certain YouTube channels may be having at any \
given moment. We will do this by scraping the descriptions of YouTube videos \
for a given list of channels and searching for keywords in the descriptions \
that typically accompany deals or promotions. The code will return a list of \
the promotions.
